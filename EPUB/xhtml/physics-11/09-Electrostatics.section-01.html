<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This chapter builds on the work covered in electrostatics in grade 10. Learners should be familiar with the two types of charges and with simple calculations of amount of charge. The following list summarises the topics covered in this chapter.</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p><strong>Coulomb's law</strong></p>

			  
<p>In this part of the topic learners are introduced to Coulomb's law. This is an inverse square law and has a similar form to Newton's law of Universal Gravitation.</p>

			  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electric fields</strong></p>

			  
<p>The concept of an electric field is introduced in this part of the chapter. Learners will see how to draw the electric field lines for different configurations of charges and will learn how to determine the magnitude of the electric field. Learners will also learn how to calculate the electric field at a point due to a number of point charges.</p>

			  </li>
</ul></div>
<p>In Grade 10, you learnt about the force between charges. In this chapter you will learn exactly how to determine this force and about a basic law of electrostatics.</p>
