  <body><h2>Summary of properties of light</h2>

<p>Imagine you are indoors on a sunny day. A beam of sunlight through a window lights up a section of the floor. How would you draw this sunbeam? You might draw a series of parallel lines showing the path of the sunlight from the window to the floor. This is not exactly accurate &#8212; no matter how hard you look, you will not find unique lines of light in the sunbeam! However, this is a good way to draw light and to model light geometrically, as we will see in this chapter.</p>

<p>We call these narrow, imaginary lines of light <strong>light rays</strong>. Recall that light can behave like a wave and so you can think of a light ray as the path of a point on the crest of a wave.</p>

<p>We can use light rays to model the behaviour of light relative to mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, and prisms. The study of how light interacts with materials is called <strong>optics</strong>. When dealing with light rays, we are usually interested in the shape of a material and the angles at which light rays hit it. From these angles, we can determine, for example, the distance between an object and its reflection. We call these methods <strong>geometrical optics</strong>.</p>
