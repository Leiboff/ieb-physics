  <body><h2>Diffraction</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting, and also very useful, properties of waves is <strong>diffraction</strong>.</p>
<dl class="definition"><dt>Diffraction</dt><dd>
            
<p>Diffraction is the ability of a wave to spread out in wavefronts as the wave passes through a small aperture or around a sharp edge.</p>

          </dd></dl><p>For example, if two rooms are connected by an open doorway and a sound is produced in a remote corner of one of them, a person in the other room will hear the sound as if it originated at the doorway.</p>

<p>This means that when waves move through small holes they appear to bend around the sides because there are not enough points on the wavefront to form another straight wavefront. This is bending round the sides we call <em>diffraction</em>.</p>

<p>Diffraction effects are more clear for water waves with longer wavelengths. Diffraction can be demonstrated by placing small barriers and obstacles in a ripple tank and observing the path of the water waves as they encounter the obstacles. The waves are seen to pass around the barrier into the regions behind it; subsequently the water behind the barrier is disturbed. The amount of diffraction (the sharpness of the bending) increases with increasing wavelength and decreases with decreasing wavelength. In fact, when the wavelength of the waves are smaller than the obstacle, no noticeable diffraction occurs.</p>

<p>This experiment demonstrates diffraction using water waves in a ripple tank. You can also demonstrate diffraction using a single slit and a light source with coloured filters.</p>

<p>Turn on the wave generator so that it produces waves with a high frequency (short wavelength).</p>

<li>
              
<p>Remove all obstacles from the ripple tank and insert a second wave generator. Turn on both generators so that they start at the same time and have the same frequency.</p>

<li>
              
<p>Now turn on the generators so that they are out of phase (i.e. start them so that they do not make waves at exactly the same time).</p>
