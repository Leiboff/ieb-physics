<p>The diagram below shows three identical waves being emitted by three point sources. A point source is something that generates waves and is so small that we consider it to be a point. It is not large enough to affect the waves. All points marked with the same letter are in phase. Join all points with the same letter.</p>

<p>What type of lines (straight, curved, etc.) do you get? How does this compare to the line that joins the sources?</p>
</div>

<p>Consider three point sources of waves. If each source emits waves isotropically (i.e. the same in all directions) we will get the situation shown in as shown in Figure <a href="#fig-p-wsl-2d3d12-wavefront" data-class="InternalLink">fig-p-wsl-2d3d12-wavefront</a> below.</p>

            Wavefronts are imaginary lines joining waves that are in phase. In the example, the wavefronts (shown by the orange, vertical lines) join all waves at the crest of their cycle.

<p>A wavefront is an imaginary line that connects waves that are in phase.</p>

		</dd></dl><p>We define a <strong>wavefront</strong> as the imaginary line that joins waves that are in phase. These are indicated by the grey, vertical lines in Figure <a href="#fig-p-wsl-2d3d12-wavefront" data-class="InternalLink">fig-p-wsl-2d3d12-wavefront</a>. The points that are in phase can be peaks, troughs or anything in between, it doesn't matter which points you choose as long as they are in phase.</p>
