  <body><h2>The speed of light</h2>

<p>One of the most exciting discoveries in physics during the last century, and the cornerstone of Einstein's Theory of Relativity, is that light travels at a constant speed in a given medium. Light also has a maximum speed at which it can propagate, and nothing can move faster than the speed of light. The maximum speed at which light can travel is when it propagates through free space (a vacuum) at <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{299\ 792\ 485}\text{ m&#183;s^{-1}}</annotation></semantics></math>. A vacuum is a region with no matter in it, not even air. However, the speed of light in air is very close to that in a vacuum.</p>

<p>We use the symbol <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">c</annotation></semantics></math> to represent the speed of light in a vacuum and approximate it as <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">c = \text{3} \times \text{10}^{\text{8}}\text{ m&#183;s^{-1}}</annotation></semantics></math></p>
