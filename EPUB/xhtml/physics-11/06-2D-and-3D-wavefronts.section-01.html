  <body><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>You have learnt about the basic properties of waves before, specifically about reflection and refraction. In this chapter, you will learn about phenomena that arise with waves in two and three dimensions: diffraction. We will also build on interference which you have learnt about previously but now in more than one dimension.</p>
